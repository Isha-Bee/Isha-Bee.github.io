# Some information about me:

* I am Isha.
* I am a first year master's student in the English Department.
* This is my first semester working on the NULab Project.


## My NULAB Project:

* I am working on the short stories of [Jhumpa Lahiri] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jhumpa_Lahiri) to look for the emotions expresses in the texts through the everyday activities and undertakings of the characters.
* I plan to make use of text tagging to denote my results.
* I would also love to extend this project after class to create an interactive emotion map.

### Inspiration for the project:

I have always loved Lahiri's work. Her short story collections [Interpreter of Maladies] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreter_of_Maladies) and [Unaccustomed Earth] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unaccustomed_Earth) have primarily Indian-American characters.
